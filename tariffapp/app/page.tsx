/*This code defines a simple React functional component named Dashboard. The component renders a div element containing the text "Dashboard". 
It's a straightforward example of a React component with no props, state, or side effects. The component is then exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of a React application. 
This Dashboard component could serve as a placeholder or a starting point for a more complex dashboard page in a web application.*/
