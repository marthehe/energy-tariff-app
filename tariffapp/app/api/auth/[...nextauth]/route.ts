/*This code configures and exports a Next.js API route handler for authentication using the NextAuth library. It's structured to handle both GET and POST requests for the authentication endpoints provided by NextAuth. 
Here's a breakdown of its components:

NextAuth Import: Imports the NextAuth function from the next-auth package. NextAuth is a complete solution for implementing authentication and authorization in Next.js applications, 
supporting various providers, databases, and features like sign-in pages, callbacks, session handling, and more.

Options Import: Imports an options object from a local module (./options). This object likely contains configuration specific to the application's authentication setup, such as providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), 
database connections, session settings, callbacks, and other NextAuth options.

Handler Initialization: Initializes the NextAuth handler by passing the options object to it. This creates an API route handler tailored to the specific authentication configuration of the application.

Exporting Handlers: Exports the initialized NextAuth handler as both GET and POST methods. This allows the same handler to respond to GET requests (e.g., fetching session data, sign-in pages) 
and POST requests (e.g., sign-in, sign-out actions) on the authentication API route.

This setup simplifies the authentication process in a Next.js application by leveraging NextAuth's comprehensive features for secure and flexible authentication handling across different request types with minimal boilerplate.*/
